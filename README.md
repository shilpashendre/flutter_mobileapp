- 1. What is the difference between Hot Reload and Hot Restart?
Ans: Hot Reload:
- Hot reload, reflects changes that are made in build() method without loosing the states. It takes lesses time than running application from start.

For Expample if we have text value whose value after performing counter function is updated to 4 and also we defined a Text value is "original Text" and we are changing it to "Update Text" and performing Hot reload than will update the text without affecting the state value of counter.
